Short manual for Julia V4.41

The program draws various Julia or Mandelbrot fractals and shows its name and
the elapsed time in the title of the window.
It works best on a fast PC with a high-resolution graphic card and true-colors.

The Mandelbrot set is the best known example of a fractal.
It includes smaller versions of itself which can be explored to arbitrary
levels of detail.
It was discovered by Benoit B. Mandelbrot who coined the name "fractal"
in 1975 from the Latin fractus or "to break".
You can explore all the fractals with the Fractal-walker.

Installation:  Unzip juliav44.zip and start juliav44.exe

Interactions with the Fractal-walker.
 Choose Julia Walker or Mandelbrot Walker in the menu View
 At this point you have activated the Fractal-walker.

You can move the fractal or zoom in or out of the fractal by using the following
cursor keys:
 - <Up>     Moves the fractal up.
 - <Down>   Moves the fractal down.
 - <Left>   Moves the fractal left.
 - <Right>  Moves the fractal right.
 - <Shift + Up>    Zooms into the fractal, the fractal is vertical stretched.
 - <Shift + Down>  Zooms out of the fractal, the fractal is vertical compressed.
 - <Shift + Left>  Zooms out of the fractal, the fractal is horizontal compressed.
 - <Shift + Right> Zooms into the fractal, the fractal is horizontal stretched.

Other function keys:
 - <+>          More details if there are any.
 - <->          Less details.
 - <Page Up>    The zoom factor is increased.
 - <Page Down>  The zoom factor is decreased.
 - <Home>       Restores the initial fractal.

Other function keys in a mandelbrot only:
 - <b>          Makes the inside of the fractal black.
 - <c>          Puts a colored pattern in the inside of the fractal.
 - <d>          Distorts the fractal. Use it several times.
 - <e>          Removes the distortion.  Use it several times.
 - <p>          Puts more patterns in the fractal. Use it several times.
 - <q>          Removes a pattern from the fractal. Use it several times.


<Shift + Right> means keep the key <Shift> pressed and press 1 time
on the cursor key <Right>.

Press the <+> when you are deep in the fractal and would like to see more
details in stead of a black screen. Explore the border on the inside between
a black part and a colored part of a mandelbrot fractal.
You can also zoom in the part at the left of the mandelbrot fractal.

In the title of the window are the parameters of the mandelbrot fractal
in the following order:
left point, right point, top, bottom,
maximum number of iterations for one pixel (details), and the elapsed time.

Enlarge your window and click with the right button in the window to see them.
You can press your next function key while plotting is in progress is in
progress.

You can also resize the window.
Use a small window on slow computers

Description of the menu JuliaV4.4

1.File
  File handling for bitmaps and parameters.
  Notes: 1.Choose parameters in the menu Options to change the size of the bitmap. 
         2.Swap colors in the menu Options after loading them in the backbuffer.
2.View
  Draws a fractal using the current parameters.
  It includes a random slide show.
  You can zoom in any part you like.

3.Options
  For changing the fractal

The program starts after you click with the right button in the window.
The parameters of the current fractal can be found in the menu Parameters.
Choose Parameters when you would like to see or experiment with the parameters.
Disable the fractals you don't want to see.


Information about the program:
==============================

JuliaV4.41 was programmed in Win32Forth version 6.14.
You can get JuliaV4.41 from the Internet at:

http://home.wxs.nl/~josv

It is there as a turnkey application with its sources.

You are free to explore and use the program JuliaV4.41 in any way you wish.

May the Forth be with you.
